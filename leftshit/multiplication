Easy trick to get result of the left shift operation, e.g.

15 << 2 = 15 * (2*2) = 60

15 << 3 = 15 * (2*2*2) = 120

15 << 5 = 15 * (2*2*2*2*2) = 480

and so on..

So it's:

(number on left) multiplied by (number on right) times 2.

Same goes for right shift operator (>>), where:

(number on left) divided by (number on right) times 2
